# Q&A

## Why did you make this?
Simple, I was bored and thought "why don't I try making a fast server software in Python?" Sure it'll be a pain but it's probably doable.

## How are you planning to implement this?
I'm going to be utilising multiprocessing and async to help me achive the speed I want the software to achieve

## Benchmarks
None yet because I don't even have main.py file

## Your code sux
Thank you, I didn't know that :)
